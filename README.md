# ScaleableTelevision
Lethal Company mod to adjust the scale of the television through config. [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) can adjust the values in game, the TV should change size when you apply the changes with no need to restart. The code may be sloppy because I don't know what I'm doing. If it wasn't for [CozyImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Spyci/CozyImprovements/) I would've never figured out how to do this. Any contributions are welcome. 

I made this for use with mods that add custom videos like [TVLoader](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Rattenbonkers/TVLoader/), most of the stuff I have is 16:9 and ends up stretched vertically.
Recommended to use this: [ObjectVolumeController](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/FlipMods/ObjectVolumeController/)
