# ScaleableTelevision
Lethal Company mod to adjust the scale of the television through config. The code is really sloppy because I don't know what I'm doing. If it wasn't for [CozyImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Spyci/CozyImprovements/) I would've never figured out how to do this. Any contributions are welcome.
