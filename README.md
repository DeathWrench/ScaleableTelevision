# ScaleableTelevision
Lethal Company mod to adjust the scale of the television through config.
The mod [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) can adjust the values in game, and the settings will be applied in real time with no need to restart the game. 

## Features
- Ability to scale television by X, Y, and Z, coordinates. If you're hosting, people without the mod will also see the changes.
- Bigger Interact Radius toggle-able config option to increase interact radius to encompass the whole TV not just where the buttons are.

If it wasn't for [CozyImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Spyci/CozyImprovements/) I would've never figured out how to do this. Any contributions are welcome. 

## Required to work
- The line in BepinEX.cfg must be set as such: HideManagerGameObject = true
