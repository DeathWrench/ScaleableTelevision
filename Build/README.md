# ScaleableTelevision
Lethal Company mod to adjust the scale of the television through config...
The mod [LethalConfig](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/AinaVT/LethalConfig/) can adjust the values in game, and the settings will be applied in real time with no need to restart the game. 

## Features
- Ability to scale television by X, Y, and Z, coordinates.
- Bigger Interact Radius toggle-able config option to increase interact radius to encompass the whole TV not just where the buttons are.

The code may be sloppy because I don't know what I'm doing. If it wasn't for [CozyImprovements](https://thunderstore.io/c/lethal-company/p/Spyci/CozyImprovements/) I would've never figured out how to do this. Any contributions are welcome. 

## Known Bug
[issue with placing the TV when Y Scale is set higher than normal](https://github.com/DeathWrench/ScaleableTelevision/issues/1)
